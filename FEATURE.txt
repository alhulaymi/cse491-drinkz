A feature I would be interested in building is party mmanger. Make a party with address, organizer (optional), list of drinks to be served, datetime and maybe a list of attendents. At this point, we could assume all users have the same level of access. However, thats bad for managing the parties or the list. Yet still this is a very early stage of the development so authentication is not an issue.

Another feature that I think is easier to implement, is to have ratings of the recipes and work something out for serving amount. Right now the application only tells us if we have enough amount to make a recipe yet there is no telling how many people can enjoy the amount we could make. This could go back to the previous requirement in case we want to know how many people can we support with the drinks we're planning to serve. And for rating, it would be fun (and very useful to learn) to limit the vote cast by IP (and maybe the date).
